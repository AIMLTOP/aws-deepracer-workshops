# WARNING:                                                                        #

# 1. Please make sure the Wi-Fi that the device connects to for the first time    #
# has Internet connection. If not, it will impact the software update and any     #
# subsequent Wi-Fi connections.                                                   #
#                                                                                 #
# 2. Do NOT change the file name or the field name of 'ssid' and 'password',      #
# which are all case sensitive.                                                   #
#                                                                                 #
# 3. Do NOT replace the default single quote signs (''), which are plain text and #
# may not be recognized by the device after editing.                              #
#                                                                                 #
#                                                                                 #
# If the USB drive was plugged into the device before, a list of available Wi-Fi  #
# networks will be automatically generated below, you can simply uncomment the    #
# one you want to connect to by removing the pound sign.                          #
#                                                                                 #
# If you have validated the Wi-Fi credentials but still find the Wi-Fi LED does   #
# not turn to solid blue, try rebooting the device by pressing the 'RESET' button #
# and then plugging in the USB drive again after the power LED turns blue.        #
#                                                                                 #
